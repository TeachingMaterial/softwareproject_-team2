# Phase 1 - Requirements Engineering

## Introduction 

## Software Process Model 
- What is software Model process.
    
    A software model process is an arrangement of processes meant to develop software, and it is an abstract representation of the process. Activities like planning, requirement analysis, designing, implementing, testing, and development are processes for developing software.
    

Different criteria can be met by using a variety of process models. These are what we call Software Development Life Cycle models, or SDLC models. The following are the key and most widely used SDLC models:

Agile model, Waterfall model, Incremental model, V model

### Waterfall

In a waterfall model, there is no phase overlap and each step must be finished before the next can start. The entire software development process is split up into distinct phases as per "The Waterfall" methodology. Usually, in this Waterfall model, the result of one phase serves as the sequential input for the following phase.
