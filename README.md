# Phase 1 - Requirements Engineering

## Introduction 

This project involves the development of an application for the setup of a library system for an educational institution, such as a university. The purpose of the system is to serve as a means for students and staff members to access various academic services such as library resources and the ability to manage their activity on the application while being dynamic enough to adjust to the needs of the consumers via a user-friendly interface.

To ensure the application for the library system is as optimal as possible, it should be designed in a way that allows users to access specific and exclusive features such as resource accessibility, learning support, assistance for teaching staff, and community collaboration. The software process model to be applied for this project will be the **Waterfall methodology**.

The team will ensure that this report includes the provision of detailed descriptions involved in the construction of the application for the library system, as well as observations and valid recommendations that may help in kick-starting the successful execution of this progressive project.
