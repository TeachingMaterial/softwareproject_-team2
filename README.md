## Introduction 

This project involves the development of an application for the setup of a library system for an educational institution, such as a university. The purpose of the system is to serve as a means for students and staff members to access various academic services such as resource accessibility, learning support, assistance for teaching staff, and community collaboration.

To ensure the application for the library system is as optimal as possible, it should be designed in a way that allows certain categories of users to access specific and exclusive features such as students having access to rent resources, being able to manage their accounts, viewing their balance, and staff having access to all application functions. The application features may also include a full description of resources in the library, fines for late transactions, encrypted payment information, unique login info for users, and other essential functions.

In summary, the development of the application for the library system will ensure that the system is dynamic enough to adjust to the needs of the users. The team aims to enhance the interaction between the community and the library system as well as boost the overall library experience via the provision of a convenient and user-friendly interface. The team will ensure that this report includes the provision of detailed descriptions involved in the construction of the application for the library system, as well as observations and valid recommendations that may help in kick-starting the successful execution of this progressive project.
