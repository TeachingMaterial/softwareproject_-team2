## Introduction 

## Software Process Model 
A software model process is an arrangement of processes meant to develop software, and it is an abstract representation of the process. Activities like planning, requirement analysis, designing, implementing, testing, and development are processes for developing software.

Different criteria can be met by using a variety of process models. These are what we call Software Development Life Cycle models, or SDLC models. The following are the key and most widely used SDLC models:

Agile model, Waterfall model, Incremental model, V model

### Waterfall
-------------

In a waterfall model, there is no phase overlap and each step must be finished before the next can start. The entire software development process is split up into distinct phases as per "The Waterfall" methodology. Usually, in this Waterfall model, the result of one phase serves as the sequential input for the following phase.

As with other development methodologies, waterfall does not include a project's end user. Client feedback is incorporated after gathering and defining initial requirements with users. Using the waterfall process eliminates the client from the main part of the process, which speeds up development.

**Advantages**

- As a rigid model, it's easy to manage - every phase has specific deliverables and a review process.
- One phase at a time is processed and completed in this model. There are no overlaps between phases.
- As hardware isn't flexible, you need to be clear about the requirements before implementing.

**Disadvantages** 

- Changing something that was not well thought out at the concept stage is very difficult after the application is in the testing stage.
- Uncertainty and high risk.
- Object-oriented and complex projects are not well suited to this model.
- Projects that take a long time to complete are poorly suited to this model.

Waterfall model consists of the following phases:

### 1. Requirement phase
In a formal requirements document, also called a functional specification, all the requirements, deadlines, and guidelines for the project are analysed.

There are also different types of requirements, including:

**User requirements:**

User requirements provide a description of what users want from the system. It also ensures that functionalities, usability, and high-level expectations are met, developer can do so by answering this question, "What should the system do for users?"

**System Requirements:**

In this section, we discuss how we will satisfy the user's requirements with our system by using specified technical details, functions, services and constraints.

**Constraints:**

Constraints describe the limitations and functionality of the system. It also considers budget, technological choices, and legal requirements when developing a system.

In our Library system, requirements like staff access control, student payment capability, rental facilities, payment verification, card verification are important. 

### 2. Design phase 
Design specifications detail technical design requirements, such as programming languages, hardware, information sources, architectures, and services.

High level design phase:

This phase involves listing and understanding the modules involved, along with determining their correlations, generating architecture diagrams, and establishing database tables.

Low level design phase: 

Low-level Design documents contain pseudocode for each module, which helps the programmer write code directly from them. Furthermore, it provides information about interfaces, error messages, dependency issues, and inputs and outputs.

### 3. Implementation phase 
This phase involves writing the source code in accordance with the requirements. A working code is created based on the physical design specifications. In order to develop a system, small programs called units are written, and then these units are integrated.

### 4. Testing phase
 By running test cases either manually or automatically, testers check the program for all possible defects. In order to ensure that all requirements are met, the client is also involved in the testing phase. Quality Assurance ensures that all bugs and flaws are repaired during this phase.

### 5. Deployment phase 
Software is deployed into a live environment so that its performance can be tested. Users can access the software as soon as it has been deployed. In some cases, real-time users are also trained during this phase in order to communicate the benefits of the system.

### 6. Maintenance phase 
It is team's job to ensure that the software that they have developed runs smoothly without any bugs or downtime. So for that, regular maintenance is necessary in order to enhance, improve and update the software.
