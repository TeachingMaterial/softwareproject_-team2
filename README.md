## Introduction 

This project involves the development of an application for the setup of a library system for an educational institution, such as a university. The purpose of the system is to serve as a means for students and staff members to access various academic services such as resource accessibility, learning support, assistance for teaching staff, and community collaboration.

To ensure the application for the library system is as optimal as possible, it should be designed in a way that allows certain categories of users to access specific and exclusive features such as students having access to rent resources, being able to manage their accounts, viewing their balance, and staff having access to all application functions. The application features may also include a full description of resources in the library, fines for late transactions, encrypted payment information, unique login info for users, and other essential functions.

In summary, the development of the application for the library system will ensure that the system is dynamic enough to adjust to the needs of the users. The team aims to enhance the interaction between the community and the library system as well as boost the overall library experience via the provision of a convenient and user-friendly interface. The team will ensure that this report includes the provision of detailed descriptions involved in the construction of the application for the library system, as well as observations and valid recommendations that may help in kick-starting the successful execution of this progressive project.

## User Requriments 
In order to get the library system as user-friendly as possible there are some basic user requirements that should be met. These are usually divided in functional and non-functional. 
### Functional requirements

Functional requirements are the key features that the system should be able to provide for all the users, they are user-focused and task-oriented.


* User Registration and Login 

Users should be able to create their account by providing personal information such as e-mail, password, date of birth, phone number, and student ID.
* Search and browse

Users should be able to search online for the books, authors, topics, journals. Clicking on a book or journal should display its details such as title, author, summary, and availability status (should display if it's  available online or on-site). 

* Rental information 

The available books or journals should be able to rent for 3days, 7days, 14 days. This information should be displayed in the details of available books and journals. 

* Renewal system

Users should be able the renew the rental period for a current book they holding direclty online in their account.
* Late fee information and payment

Users should be notified about the library's late fee policy and the charges applied with it. Each late day is 10p with maximum fine being the value of the book. It should calculate the fine and inform the account user and should be available to pay it straight away online in the app with a payment validation check.
* Account Management

Users should be able to view and edit their profile, borrowing history and the due dates in their account management section.

### Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements are usually a bit more technical and are responsible for the quality, performance and security part of the user-system experience.

* Usability 

The system should be easy and straitforward to use, efficient and fast enough.

* Security 

Users should be protected against the data leaking, unauthorized access, and malicious software.

* Portability and compatibility

The system should be able to run on different operating systems and should be compatible with the lastest versions of the most known and used operating system and online environments.
